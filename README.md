# PYYNE IDE Simulator

This repository is a TS React component that renders an IDE with code and a "view" component (like a terminal), both animated.

You can see it [here](https://playground.pyyne.com/ide-sim).

## Usage

You may clone this repository and generate a build for your own, add it as a submodule, or reference it via a private NPM repo.

## Customisation

Most of the component's appearance can be customised via props. The secondary component can be changed for your own or removed entirely by omitting it from this component's children.
